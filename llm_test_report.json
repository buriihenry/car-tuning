      "name": "Stage 2 ECU Remap",
      "description": "A Stage 2 ECU remap for a 2021 BMW 3 Series with a petrol engine involves recalibrating the engine control unit (ECU) to optimize parameters such as fuel injection, ignition timing, and boost pressure (if turbocharged). This takes advantage of the increased exhaust flow provided by the existing sport exhaust. A reputable tuner will use a dyno to create a custom map tailored to the car's specific modifications and fuel type, ensuring optimal performance and safety. The process typically involves flashing a new software map onto the ECU, potentially disabling or modifying factory safety features for improved output. It requires careful monitoring of engine vitals during the tuning process, especially air-fuel ratio (AFR) and knock sensitivity.",

        "20-35% power increase",
        "Enhanced torque delivery",
        "Customizable power curves",

      "name": "Big Brake Kit",
      "description": "A big brake kit (BBK) typically consists of larger diameter brake rotors, multi-piston calipers, high-performance brake pads, and stainless steel brake lines. The larger rotors increase the leverage and surface area for braking, while multi-piston calipers provide more even clamping force across the brake pads. High-performance brake pads offer a higher coefficient of friction and improved fade resistance at high temperatures. Stainless steel brake lines minimize brake pedal flex and provide a more consistent pedal feel. This upgrade significantly improves stopping power, heat dissipation, and brake fade resistance, crucial for track use.  Specifically, you will be looking for calipers with 4 or 6 pistons, and rotors which can be either drilled, slotted, or plain face. Rotor diameter is typically 380-400mm for the front brakes and 345-380 for the rear.",
